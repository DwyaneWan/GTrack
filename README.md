# GTrack
GTrack is a website application that stores the details and general information of student projects going on at Georgia Tech. It uses python Flask framework and it connects to MySQL DBMS at the back end. The data stores in the database include the project milestones, grades for submissions, team membersâ€™ duties and schedules, etc.
GTrack is implemented following a [tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-crud-web-app-with-python-and-flask-part-one) on Scotch.io by Mbithe Nzomo.
